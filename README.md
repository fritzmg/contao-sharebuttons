Contao Share Buttons
===================

Simple extension to provide share buttons as a module, content element and for news articles in Contao. In each case you have the same set of options.

## Themes

In each case you can also set an optional theme. If you select a theme, basic styling is included for the buttons, making them align horizontally and applying background images. These are the current available themes:

From top to bottom:

- Boxxed
- Boxxed (16px)
- Contao
- Light
- Shadow
- Simple Flat
- Simple Icons Black
- Simple Icons White (grey background added for visibility)

The "Contao" theme uses Contao's own icons, however only Facebook, Twitter and Google+ is available there. There is also a theme called "Text", which simply aligns the elements horizontally, but leaves the textual content of each button visible.

The following themes offer higher resolution images for devices with high DPI:

- Boxxed (16px)
- Light
- Shadow
- Simple Icons Black 
- Simple Icons White

## Template

You can also set the template in each element, if you happen to need a different structure in some cases. If you want to use your own template, create one with a name that starts with `sharebuttons_` in your templates folder.

## News

You can output share buttons directly in your news templates:

```php
<?php echo $this->sharebuttons; ?>
```

You can set the options for the news sharebuttons either in the news archive or in each news entry currently. The selected social networks will be merged, while the other settings are prioritized for the news entry, whenever specified.

Using the share buttons in news articles this way is especially important, if you want to show share buttons in a news list â€” otherwise the url and title will not be correct (since the share buttons just use the url and title of the current page otherwise).

## Insert Tag

Since version 1.1.0 there is also an insert tag available. The name of the insert tag is `sharebuttons`, the first parameter is the theme and the following parameter are the networks separated by a single colon:

```
{{sharebuttons::THEME::NETWORK:NETWORK:...}}
```

The following insert tag would create share buttons with the `boxxed` theme with all currently available social networks:

```
{{sharebuttons::boxxed::facebook:twitter:gplus:linkedin:xing:mail:tumblr:pinterest:reddit}}
```

The theme parameter is optional. The following insert tag would simply generate the HTML source for a Facebook, Twitter and Google+ share button, without including a stylesheet for a theme:

```
{{sharebuttons::facebook:twitter:gplus}}
```

Have a look at the `$GLOBALS['sharebuttons']['themes']` and `$GLOBALS['sharebuttons']['networks']` array in [`config/config.php`](https://github.com/fritzmg/contao-sharebuttons/blob/master/system/modules/sharebuttons/config/config.php) in order to find the key-string for your desired networks and theme.
